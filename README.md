## Authors:
**catalyticFoam** has been developed in the Multiscale Catalysis Group of the Laboratory of Catalysis and Catalytic Processes of Politecnico di Milano.

## Compulsory libraries:
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
- [RapidXML](http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/)
- [Boost C++](http://www.boost.org/)
- [OpenSMOKE++][1] (provided with the current version of catalyticFoam)

## Compilation
Instructions:
1. Open the `mybashrc`, choose the version of OpenFOAM you are using (4.x = 40, 5.x = 50) and adjust the paths to the compulsory external libraries
2. Type: `source mybashrc`
3. Type: `./Allwmake`

## Run your first case
The folder `example/case` contains a simple test case (2D honeycomb channel).

1. Build the mesh using the `blockMesh` utility, 
2. Run the case using the `catalyticPimpleFoam` solver. 

The folder `example/case_isat` contains a simple test case (2D honeycomb channel) simulated with the ISAT library.

1. Build the mesh using the `blockMesh` utility, 
2. Run the case using the `catalyticPimpleFoam` solver. 

The folder `example/sphere` contains a 4-spheres string reactor.
1. Build the mesh with `./makeMesh`
2. Run the case using the `catalyticPimpleFoam` solver. 

## Compile a kinetic scheme
The pre-processing of a kinetic scheme requires:
1. Create a new folder with the kinetic scheme
2. Create the kinetic.kin, surface.sur according to the kinetic mechanism
3. Provide the termodynamic (thermo.tdc) and transport (transport.tra)  databases
4. Create the input.dic input file (see example)
5. Compile the mechanism with `catalyticFoam_CHEMKINPreProcessor`
